# Custom Cipher Encryption Program

# Overview
This program demonstrates a custom encryption technique that combines a monoalphabetic substitution cipher with columnar and row transpositions. The result is a robust encryption scheme that transforms readable text into an unreadable format. This example helps to illustrate the basic principles behind more complex encryption techniques.

# Features
Substitution Cipher: Each letter of the alphabet is replaced with another letter, creating an encoded message that is difficult to decipher without knowing the specific letter mappings.
Columnar Transposition: The text is rearranged into columns and read in a specific order, further obfuscating the original message.
Row Transposition: Rows are shuffled, adding an additional layer of complexity to the encryption.

# Requirements
Python 3.x

# How to Use
Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/custom-cipher-encryption.git
cd custom-cipher-encryption
Run the Encryption Program

The program encrypts a sample text (included in the script) and saves the encrypted text to a file.
python exercise_7.py

# Encrypted Output
The encrypted text is saved to encrypted_text.txt. The exact contents will vary each time the program is run due to the random nature of the substitution cipher and transpositions.
